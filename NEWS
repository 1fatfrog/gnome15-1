gnome15 0.9.6 (2013-09-01)
==========================

Gnome15 is a suite of tools for the Logitech G series keyboards and
headsets, including the G15, G19, G13, G930, G35, G510, G11, G110 and
the Z-10 speakers aiming to provide the best integration possible with
the Linux Desktop.

Gnome15 provides:
* A panel indicator (or applet)
* A configuration tool
* A macro system
* A set of plugins

Developers can extend Gnome15 by writing plugins in the Python
programming language, or they can use the provided D-Bus API.
Gnome15 uses GNOME technologies, while staying well integrated with
other desktops such as Ubuntu Unity and XFCE. It should also work with
KDE.

About this release
------------------

Release 0.9.6 was focused on simplifying and cleaning up the source
code tree as well as the build system.
The new structure has less levels of depth and should be simpler to
maintain on the long term.
Most of the previous sub-projects that were maintained separatedly are
now aggregated into a single tree.
Besides some external dependencies, gnome15 can now be build by
issuing a single './configure; make; make install' command.

The kernel modules have also been updated with the latest upstream
changes.

Of course, some bugs were also fixed.

This is also the first release of Gnome15 to be a 'official' one.
Brett Smith, the original maintainer has decided to retire himself from
the project, and he supports what was until now a unofficial fork of
Gnome15.

He will however keep contributing to the project.
