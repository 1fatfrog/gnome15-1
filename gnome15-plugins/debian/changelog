gnome15-plugins (0.7.2-1) natty; urgency=low

  * Feature: First release of separated plugins.
  * Feature: IM - New plugin to show current instant messenger contacts 
    (telepathy based clients only)
  * Feature: LDCShot - New plugin to take screenshot of LCD (location 
    configurable)
  * Feature: Mounts - New plugin to display current drive mounts (allows 
    eject etc)
  * Feature: Tweak - New plugin to allow access to some hidden settings 
    (scroll speed etc)
  * Feature: Cairo Clock - Now supports G15 and other monochrome models. 
    However, you can't use any old Cairo Clock theme, special bitmap themes must
    be crafted. A single simple theme is indcluded.
  * Feature: Cairo Clock - "Sweeping seconds" option for smooth second hand
    animation (uses more CPU, so is disabled by default)
  * Feature: Cairo Clock - Gnome15 also now ships with default themes for the
    G19, in case cairo clock is not installed.
  * Feature: Cairo Clock - Can now show digital time on the face as well
  * Feature: Calendar - Events are now shown in a scrollable area. You may
    switch between this area using the "View" action (Cog key on G19, L2 on the
    monochrome models). Events may be selected, but nothing happens yet.
  * Feature: Calendar - Events that last longer than a day, all days will be
    highlighted.
  * Feature: Menu - Menu is now activated by holding L2 on the G15 (instead
    of just pressing it).
  * Feature: Menu - Menu is now sorted alphabetically.
  * Feature: Impulse - New "Disco mode" that flashes the keyboard in time
    with audio
  * Feature: Impulse - Now has support for keyboards without screens, can use
    M-Key lights as  a simple level meter 
  * Feature: Impulse - Frame rate option added to decrease CPU usage         
  * Feature: Impulse - Automatically decreases frame rate if when there is
    no audio                           
  * Feature: Indicator Me - Now allows changing of current status                           
  * Feature: Indicator Messages - Will blink the M-Key lights when there is a
    message waiting. This allows the plugin to be useful on plugins without
    screens.                           
  * Feature: Indicator Messages - Automatic popup on menu change may now be
    disabled.                           
  * Feature: Macro Recorder - Blinks the MR light (and the current bank key)
    while recording is in progress. This allows the plugin to be useful on
    plugins without screens.                           
  * Feature: Macro Information - Rewritten to use the standard Gnome15 menu                             
  * Feature: MPRIS - Fixed problem where track progress would exceed 100%
    and keep growing.
  * Feature: MPRIS - Fixed problem where MPRIS would cause Gnome15 and the
    Media Player to hang for 10 seconds when the track changes and the
    NotifyLCD plugins is enabled.                              
  * Feature: MPRIS - Some artwork locations could cause sever lag and CPU
    spikes. This should be improved.
  * Feature: MPRIS - Panel artwork icon fixed.
  * Feature: Notify - Can now operate in "Passive mode". This works by rather
    than replacing the notification daemon, it simply watches for notify events
    being send to the standard notification service. This allows the Notify
    plugin to work on desktops where it is near impossible to kill the standard
    notification service, or when you messages to appear on your desktop AND
    the keyboard LCD.
  * Feature: Notify - Can now blink M-Key lights when notifications are
    received.
  * Feature: Screensaver - Keyboard backlight now gently fades when screensaver
    activated (when dimming is turned on).
  * Feature: Screensaver - Added support for screenless models that have a
    backlight (G110, G11)

    it is running (as a high priority screen).
