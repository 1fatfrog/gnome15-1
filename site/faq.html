		<h1>FAQ</h1>			
		<h2>General Questions</h2>
		<h3>What keyboard models are currently supported by Gnome15?</h3>
		<p>Currently only the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logitech_G15">Logitech</a> G15 (v1) and <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/keyboards/keyboard/devices/4956">Logitech G19</a>
		are supported (these are the two keyboards I have access to). Support for the other keyboards on the range will currently depend
		on support provided by g15daemon. There are patches available for at least the G13, although you are on your own here and I
		cannot guarantee it will work correctly in Gnome15. Efforts will soon begin to add support for other hardware.</p>
		<h3>Why does indicator menu not show the current screens on Ubuntu 10.4, yet it does on Ubuntu 10.10</h3>
		<p>Because screens come and go (e.g. with enabling / disabling of plugins), the indicator menu must be able
		to rebuilt at any time. Unfortunately, this is not possible in Lucid. A work-around may be available in a future
		release. As an alternative, you could use the applet version instead.</p>
		<h2>G15 Questions</h2>
		<h3>Why is text not appearing on the LCD? Or why is the text hard to read?</h3>	
		<p>To get the best results, the G15 driver requires that fixed size bitmap fonts are used to display text
		(currently the 'Fixed' font is used). Recent versions of Ubuntu at least disable these fonts by default. 
		The Ubuntu gnome15 package tries to	enable them for you, but for other distributions you will have to do
		this yourself. See this	<a href="http://ptspts.blogspot.com/2010/06/how-to-enable-bitmap-fonts-on-ubuntu.html">post</a>
		for more information and a possible solution.</p> 
		<h2>G19 Questions</h2>
		<h3>Why does Gnome15 use so much CPU when drawing the screen on the G19?</h3>
		<p>You will see this if you are using a version of Cairo less than 1.8.3. This is because the 
		16 bit image format that that G19 requires was disabled in Cairo for a number of years and only
		recently re-introduced. Without this native support, Gnome15 has convert the image itself which is
		currently very slow.</p>
		<p>The solution, ensure you are using at least Cairo 1.8.3.</p>
