<h1>Gnome tools for the Logitech G Series Keyboards And Z-10
Speakers</h1>
<div class="rightscreenshots"><img width="281" height="255"

</div>
<div id="summary">
<p>Gnome15 provides a panel indicator (or applet), configuration
tool, macro system and plugin framework for the Logitech G series
keyboards, including the G15 and G19. The intention is to provide the
best integration with the Gnome desktop possible, using the standard
protocols and libraries where appropriate.</p>
<p>Written using Python, PyGTK and PyCairo, Gnome15 is easy to
extend. Plugins can optionally use SVG for theme support.</p>
See the <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a> page for a full list of pre-requisites. Native packages
are currently available for Ubuntu 10.4, 10.10 and Arch Linux.</div>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>Gnome15 is known to work with the following device and driver
combinartions :-</p>
<ul>
	<li><a
		href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/keyboards/keyboard/devices/4956">G19
	Gaming Keyboard</a>. Requires either <a href="g19d.html">G19D</a> or a <a
		href="kernel.html">Patched Kernel</a>.</li>
	<li><a
		href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/gaming/mice-keyboard-combos/devices/3498">G15
	Gaming Keyboard</a>. Requires <a href="http://www.g15tools.com/">g15daemon</a>.
	<a href="kernel.html">Patched Kernel</a> support is being worked on.</li>
	<li><a

	Advanced Gameboard</a>. Requires <a href="http://www.g15tools.com/">g15daemon</a>
	(recent version). <a href="kernel.html">Patched Kernel</a> support is being worked on.
	<span style="color: red;">Note, the kernel patch support for this device will come 
	last as I do not have access to one. Also, it is not known if Gnome15 works with 
	the g15daemon driver correctly for this device. Feedback would be appreciated.

<h3>Plugins</h3>
<div class="section">
<ul>
	<li><span style="background: blue; color: white;">New!</span>
	G15Daemon. Available only on the G19, this is a network server compatible with the g15daemon
	protocol. This allows you to use g15daemon compatible scripts and applications on a G19 such
	as g15stats, g15composer, mumble, etc.</li>
	<li><span style="background: blue; color: white;">New!</span>
	Processes. Lists all running processes and allows you to kill them.</li>
	<li>
	LCDBiff. POP3/IMAP email checker. An alternative to the Indicator
	Messages plugin if your system does not use indicators. Supports
	multiple accounts, SSL, displays summary of total unread emails in each
	account.</li>
	<li>Menu. Displays list of available screens and allows selection.
	Activated by the MENU key on the G19, or L2 on the G15.</li>
	<li>Impulse15. Port of the <a
		href="https://launchpad.net/impulse.bzr">Impulse</a> screenlet and
	desktop widget. Adds a spectrum analyser.</li>
	<li>Panel. Reserves an area at the bottom of the LCD for other
	plugins to add miniature components that are always available.</li>
	<li>Clock. Simple demonstration plugin.</li>
	<li>Cairo Clock. For the G19 only, a port of MacSlow's Cairo
	Clock. It renders any Cairo Clock theme on the LCD.</li>
	<li>Notify LCD. A notify-osd replacement for notifications. NOTE,
	this plugin currently tries to kill the 'notify-osd' process and take
	over notifications before notify-osd can restart. This doesn't always
	work. I will look for a better solution, but in the mean time, try
	killing your notification daemon manually before starting this plugin.</li>
	<li>Calendar. Integrates with Evolution to show a highlighted
	month calendar, and todays events. You can scroll though the calendar
	using the extended keys.</li>
	<li>RSS reader. Supports multiple feeds and formats.</li>
	<li>Screensaver. Detects when screensaver becomes active and dims
	the keyboard and displays a message. Warn off your foes!</li>
	<li>Indicator Me. Shows your current IM status.</li>
	<li>Volume monitor. Displays volume gauge when it changes.
	Currently uses Python ALSA bindings.</li>
	<li>Weather. Displays current outlook, temperature, and 4 day
	forecast. Uses Google weather API.</li>
	<li>System Monitor. Displays current CPU, Network and Memory
	summary.</li>
	<li>Media Player. Displays current track information, progress and
	cover art. Supports any player that supports the MPRIS protocol (v1 or
	v2). This includes Rhythmbox, Banshee, Audacious, XMMS2 and more.</li>
	<li>Special effect. Adds two effects for cycling through screens,
	a slide effect and a fade effect. Due to the nature of the G15
	monochrome LCD, the fade effect is more of a 'disolve', but it's quite
	cool anyway :)</li>
	<li>Wallpaper. Display any background image on the LCD.</li>
	<li>Experimental video player. Currently requires mplayer to be
	installed and is quite intensive. It works by having mplayer generate
	JPEG images which Gnome15 loads. It was written to prove the G15 could
	handle video fast enough, so the eventual aim is to change this to
	provide a GStreamer sink connected to the LCD</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<div class="section">
<ul>
	<li>0.4.0 - Experimental G110 and G510 support. Fixed incorrect Sysmon plugin memory units. Screensaver text alignment.
		Applet now displays screens on left click, or preferences on right click. RSS refreshes feeds at specified interval
		correctly. Allow boot up keyboard color to be set (G19 only). Remembers last visible screen on startup.

	<li>0.3.1 - G15 Panel support finally. Cycle screens options gets set correctly upon starting g15-config.
  	LCDBiff plugin actually counts IMAP mails now. Fixed crash in LCDBiff when accessing 
  	gnome keyring.  Many theme fixes and adjustments for G15 and other monochrome displays. Main
    change was re-arranging to accomodate the panel, but other stuff was fixed along the way.
    System Monitor plugin can now show specific CPU or Network Interface details 
    cycle with Up/Down on the G19, and L3/L4 on others
	<li>0.3.0 - Possible fix for G19 problem with multimedia keys
	locking system. New LCDBiff plugins. Kernel driver support added. Expanded Notifications
	options. Allow animation speed to be set for special effects plugin. Improvements
	to switch the driver at runtime.</li>
	<li>0.2.1 - Fixes error with missing OffScreenWindow preventing
	startup. Notify plugin now completely implements notification DBUS
	spec. Indicator may be hidden when there are no errors.</li>
	<li>0.2.0 - New <i>Indicator Messages</i> plugin. Performance
	improvements..</li>
	<li>0.1.0 - Minor stability fixes, added simple man pages. Memory
	banks can be assigned keyboard backlight colours (G19 only).</li>
	<li>0.0.9 - The 3 drivers are now available as separate packages.
	Many other package installation fixes. Impulse15 can now paint on the
	background or foreground of other screens (instead of just it's own
	screen').</li>
	<li>0.0.5 - New plugins <i>Menu</i>, <i>Panel</i> and <i>Impulse</i>.
	Now uses the <i>Indicator</i> system on where available (continue to
	use applet where not available). BAMF is now used for activating macro
	profiles based on active window. This is more accurate and faster.</li>
	<li>0.0.4 - Fixed some problems with packages. Allow G19 to work
	on Cairo versions less than 1.8.3. Cairo clock hour hand drawn at
	correct place (and more themes supported). RSS shows entry date instead
	of todays date.</li>
	<li>0.0.3 - G19 support. SVG themes. New MPRIS, RSS and Cairo
	Clock plugins. Improvements to Macro UI.</i>.
	<li>0.0.2 - Notify OSD replacement. Evolution calendar
	integration. I have also started abstracting the driver code out, ready
	to add some support for the G19 (and eventually G13 and G15 v2). As
	part of this, a 'Gtk' driver has been added that displays the LCD as a
	window on your desktop (along with simulated G, L, M and Light keys).
	You can enable this by setting the GConf key <i>/apps/gnome15/driver</i>
	to <i>gtk</i>.
