This folder contains the Java bindings for Gnome15. It allows you to add
support to your applications using the DBUS API.

The source for the Java DBUS bindings (and it's associated libraries)
are also kept here, as I could find no suitable mavenised libraries. See
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings for more information.

Requirements
------------

Maven 
JDK 1.5.0 or higher.
GCC

Building
--------

So, to build the bindings, first build and install libmatthew :-

$ cd libmatthew
$ mvn clean install

Then build the bindings themselves :-

$ cd ../gnome15-java-group
$ mvn clean package

You will end up with .tar files in gnome15-java-assembly/target

Note
----

This is a flat Maven project, as I work in Eclipse most of the time.
