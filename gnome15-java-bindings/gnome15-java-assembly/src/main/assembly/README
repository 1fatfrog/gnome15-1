Gnome15 Java Bindings
=====================

Provides Java integration with Gnome15, a framework to provide access to the LCD and
macro keys on Logitech "G" series keyboards.

These Gnome15 bindings use the dbus-java (http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-java/)
bindings, and so require a native library. Please ensure you have the right library
for your platform and architecture.

Running the Example
-------------------

You will need:

 1. JDK 1.5 (not the JRE, a compiler is required for the example)
 2. Gnome15
 3. Optionally, a supported Logitech keyboard. If you do not have real hardware,
    you can use Gnome15's emulator mode.
    
The gnome15-java-all file actually has the example class included, so to run it :- 

$ java -Djava.library.path=. -jar gnome15-java-all.jar

Alternatively, you can compile and run the example using the provided script

$ cd example
$ sh run-example.sh

The example should then compile. When complete, a new screen will appear on the 
keyboard's LCD showing a counter going from 1 to 1000. 

Integrating with your application
---------------------------------

You will need to add either the 3 separate JAR files to your CLASSPATH :-

 dbus-java.jar
 gnome15-java.jar
 libmatthew-java.jar
 
 .. OR, add the single JAR :-
 
 gnome15-java-all.jar
 
Either way, you will also need to ensure the native library is in a location it
can be loaded. You can tell Java where to load it from using type java.library.path
system property.
