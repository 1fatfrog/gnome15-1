SSHAPI
======

SSHAPI serves as a simple facade or abstraction for various SSH
client implementations (or providers as they are known in this API) such
as Maverick SSH or JSch.

It allows the user to plug in the required provider at deployment
time or even run time depending on their needs, for example because of specific
performance, feature or licensing requirements.

SSHAPI will search the CLASSPATH for providers, and choose the 
best one for the requested configuration (or just a default). The 
behavior of the discovery can be configured using system properties.

Specific providers can also be chosen manually at connection time. This
makes it possible to use different providers depending on configuration
of the connection, yet still use a single API for your application.

Usage
=====

You will need to include at least 3 libraries in order to use SSHAPI :-

1. The core API library. This may be found in the lib directory named
   sshapi-[[version].jar
   
2. At least one provider bridge library. This may be found in the lib
   directory named sshapi-[provider]-[version].jar. You may include
   more than provider if you wish.
   
3. The Jar(s) required for the provider itself. This distribution does
   not include any providers, so you will have to obtain one yourself.
   See the documentation for the provider for more information on what
   you should include.

for the most common uses of SSH.
