SSHAPI
======

SSHAPI serves as a simple facade or abstraction for various SSH
client implementations (or providers as they are known in this API) such
as Maverick SSH or JSch.

It allows the user to plug in the required provider at deployment
time or even run time depending on their needs, for example because of specific
performance, feature or licensing requirements.

SSHAPI will search the CLASSPATH for providers, and choose the 
best one for the requested configuration (or just a default). The 
behavior of the discovery can be configured using system properties.

Specific providers can also be chosen manually at connection time. This
makes it possible to use different providers depending on configuration
of the connection, yet still use a single API for your application.

This Distribution
==================

This is the source distribution of SSHAPI. It is comprised of all of the
public SSHAPI modules


sshapi-group			Parent Maven Project
sshapi-core				The core API and utilities
sshapi-examples			Examples and example source
sshapi-maverick			Maverick provider bridge
sshapi-j2ssh			J2SSH provider bridge
sshapi-ganymed			Ganymed provider bridge
sshapi-jsch				JSch provider bridge

Depending on your environment, you may need to download the appropriate
provider implementation library. See below.

You have a few different options for building from source.

Maven
-----

Simply run the the 'compile' goal in the same directory as this
file.

$ cd $HOME/sshapi-[version].jar
$ mvn compile

This will download all dependencies required. The exception is Maverick,
which is a commercially available library and not in any Maven repository.
See sshapi-examples/Maverick-README.txt for more information. 

Ant
---

As with Maven, ensure you are in the same directory as this file, and then
run 'compile' target.  

$ cd $HOME/sshapi-[version].jar
$ ant compile
 
This will download all dependencies required. The exception is Maverick,
which is a commercially available library and not in any Maven repository.
See sshapi-examples/Maverick-README.txt for more information.
