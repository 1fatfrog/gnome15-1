Description: Daemon to support G19 keyboard features
 A daemon to support the additional features of the Logitech
 G19 keyboard, including the additional keys and the colour
 LCD screen. Based on "Logitech-G19-Linux-Daemon"
 (http://github.com/MultiCoreNop/Logitech-G19-Linux-Daemon),
 the work of "MultiCoreNop" (http://github.com/MultiCoreNop), 
 this code was adapted for use with Gnome15 until such a time
 as kernel support is available. NOTE: This package is 
 deprecated. It is recommended you now use the g19direct driver.
