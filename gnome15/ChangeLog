0.7.2

    Bug: g15-config would re-enable devices as soon as disabled (multi device setup)
    Bug: Changing keyboard backlight colour was not visible when a profile with a backlight colour is set. Now, the colour is shown for 3 seconds, before reverting to the profile colour.
    Bug: M2, M3 colours were not working
    Bug: Macro change saves are now deferred by 2 seconds. If another change occurs withing this time, the timer is reset.

    Bug: Configuration upgrade would fail on Python < 2.7
    Feature: Joystick now works on G13 with G15direct and kernel drivers. May emulate mouse, joystick, or send macros.

0.7.1

    Bug: LCD fade works better
    Feature: "Global Plugins" concept introduced. Tweak plugin is now of this type.
    Feature: New "g15direct" direct. This does away with g15daemon and uses libg15 directly. Also now works correctly (more or less) with the G13. This is now the recommended driver for all devices other than the G19 until the kernel driver bugs are ironed out.
    Bug: MPRIS < 2.1 clients were broken (inc. Banshee)
    Bug: Banshee seek time usually incorrect.
    Bug: Notify plugin in passive mode breaks other DBUS clients (causing hangs)

0.7.0

    Feature: IM Plugin - Shows current instant messenger contacts (telepathy based clients only)
    Feature: LDCShot Plugin - Take screenshot of LCD (location configurable), press and hold MR to take a shot.
    Feature: Mounts Plugin - Display current drive mounts (allows eject etc)
    Feature: Tweak - Allows access to some hidden settings (scroll speed etc)
    Feature: Packaged and tested on more distributions. Fedora 15 and Debian 6 have been added. All packages are now built at the Open Builder Service.
    Feature: The LG4L kernel drivers have been packaged for DKMS, and is now the recommended driver for all the models it supports (G110, G13, G15 and G110).
    Feature: Mouse wheel now works on system tray (not indicator version). Up and down flip between screens. If you have it, left and right will either cycle backlight colours / levels, or when switch between the 'active' screen, i.e. the one that gets scrolled with the up and down events.
    Feature: Support added for G11 (limited set of plugins).
    Feature: g19daemon package has been removed (and the Gnome15 package gnome15-g19d). Please use gnome15-g19direct driver instead. If you need G19D, you will have to compile from source.
    Feature: Plugins now in separate module
    Feature: Now handles multiple simultaneous devices.
    Feature: DBUS API layout change. See site documentation for details.
    Feature: Project layout changed, gnome15 and gnome15-plugins are now the two main projects. Various components are now disabled or enabled using ./configure options.
    Feature: Start of support for the old MX5500 (I am expecting to obtain one soon to finish the driver work)
    Feature: Scrolling Text. Everywhere where text might overflow, it will now scroll within it's bounds.
    Feature: Improvements to plugins that make change keyboard backlight colour. Any operations that change the colour of any keyboard lights will only do so temporarily. When that operation is finished, the lights will return to their previous state. For example, increase your Volume, and the M-Key lights will temporarily acts as a level meter, then return to whatever state they were at when the volume stops changing.
    Feature: Improvements to keyboard handling. Plugins now use 'actions' rather than hard coded key codes. Coupled with the ability to hold keys down for a different action, this will allow the MX5500 to be operable using only the two LCD navigation keys it has. Some key mappings for the G15 related models have also altered as a result of this (for example, Page Up and Page Down is now possible by holding L3 or L4). NOTE, this has meant the default key mappings have changed, especially on the G15 like models. Don't worry though if you don't like the new mappings, they will be user-configurable in version 0.8.x.
    Feature: G19 fades the LCD and keyboard backlight when Gnome15 shutsdown
    Feature: Logout, Shutdown and Restart are all now detected and shutdown Gnome15 cleanly (with fading)
    Feature: Many API changes and improvements. Comments have been added to lots of the core source (with more to follow).
    Feature: The SETUID lgsetled is no longer required. It has been replaced by g15-system-service which is part of the core application. This
    is a system bus service that has the sole job of writing setting backlights and other LED values for the kernel driver.
    Bug: Memory leak fixes. The main memory leak that Gnome15 suffered is now fixed. It turned out to be caused by pango layouts, and so any plugin that used this was contributing to the problem. This is include Cairo Clock, Clock, Weather and anything that had wrapped vertical text (e.g. screensaver message). The  cause was finally discovered due to the new scrolling feature made use of layouts and chewed up memory even faster!
    Bug: Screens in the indicator applet / system tray applet are now sorted alphabetically.
    Bug: Packages no longer pull in compiz as well (cause by cairo-clock being Recommends rather than Suggests)
    Feature: Cairo Clock - Now supports G15 and other monochrome models. However, you can't use any old Cairo Clock theme, special bitmap themes must be crafted. A single simple theme is indcluded.
    Feature: Cairo Clock - "Sweeping seconds" option for smooth second hand animation (uses more CPU, so is disabled by default)
    Feature: Cairo Clock - Now ships with default themes for the G19, in case cairo clock is not installed.
    Feature: Cairo Clock - Can now show digital time on the face as well
    Feature: Calendar - Events are now shown in a scrollable area. You may switch between this area using the "View" action (Cog key on G19, L2 on the monochrome models). Events may be selected, but nothing happens yet.
    Bug: Calendar - Events that last longer than a day, all days will be highlighted.
    Feature: Menu - Now activated by holding L2 on the G15 (instead of just pressing it).
    Feature: Menu - Is now sorted alphabetically.
    Feature: Impulse - New "Disco mode" that flashes the keyboard in time with audio.
    Feature: Impulse - Now has support for keyboards without screens, can use M-Key lights as  a simple level meter.
    Feature: Impulse - Frame rate option added to decrease CPU usage.
    Feature: Impulse - Automatically decreases frame rate if when there is no audio.
    Feature: Indicator Me - Allows changing of your current status
    Feature: Indicator Messages - Will blink the M-Key lights when there is a message waiting. This allows the plugin to be useful on plugins without screens.
    Feature: Indicator Messages -Automatic popup on menu change may now be disabled.
    Feature: Macro Recorder - Blinks the MR light (and the current bank key) while recording is in progress. This allows the plugin to be useful on plugins without screens.
    Feature: Macro Information - Rewritten to use the standard Gnome15 menu.
    Feature: Macro Information - Automatic popup on change can be disabled
    Bug: MPRIS - Fixed problem where track progress would exceed 100% and keep growing.
    Bug: MRPIS - Fixed problem where MPRIS would cause Gnome15 and the Media Player to hang for 10 seconds when the track changes and the NotifyLCD plugins is enabled.
    Bug: MPRIS - Some artwork locations could cause severe lag and CPU spikes. This should be improved, although there are still some issues when you use massive images.
    Bug MPRIS - Panel artwork fixed
    Feature: Notify - Can now operate in "Passive mode". This works by rather than replacing the notification daemon, it simply watches for notify events being send to the standard notification service. This allows the Notify plugin to work on desktops where it is near impossible to kill the standard notification service, or when you messages to appear on your desktop AND the keyboard LCD.
    Feature: Notify - Can now blink M-Key lights when notifications are received
    Feature: Screensaver - Keyboard backlight now gently fades when screensaver activated (when dimming is turned on).
    Feature: Screensaver - Added support for screenless models that have a backlight (G110, G11)

    Feature: Configuration - If mulitple devices are available, they will be displayed down the left hand sand of the user inteface. Selecting each
    device will allow configuration of its plugins, macros and other settings.
    Feature: Configuration - "About" details moved out of main plugin information area into a separate dialog.
    Feature: Configuration - Each plugin now shows the keys it uses (appropriate for the model)
