gnome15 0.5.0 (2011-03-09)

    Big changes under the hood. g15-desktop-service is now the
    process that manages the plugins, LCD and macros. Panel
    integration is now provided by separate packages.
    
    Macro creation and editing in the configuration UI is now
    possible.
    
    Lots of bug fixes as well (see the changelog).
